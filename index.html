        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
            started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
            kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
            when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.
            I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
            favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of
            advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
            vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
            an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different
            cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.
            I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it
            at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very
            challenging.</p>
